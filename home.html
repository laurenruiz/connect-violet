Hello, and welcome to ConnectViolet! We are a student-run organization that's goal is to support and connect minority women in STEM, but we welcome everyone! After taking the “initial personality test” you will be assigned historical women in STEM with your same personality type! Based on the historical figure you were assigned, you will be entered into a discord server with other individuals with the same personality type! We hope you can connect through these servers and get to know more people on campus with similar traits to yourself! Our goal is to raise awareness about women in stem and to build a community for those in it. We welcome everyone to our organization, but our main purpose is to support minority women. We do not condone any discrimination of any sort and welcome everyone to join! Also, make sure to check out the list of all the iconic minority women in history! Happy Connecting!
